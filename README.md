## 🔍 Overview

- **Objective:** Classify customers into churn vs. non-churn categories.
- **Why it matters:** Retaining existing customers is 5× cheaper than acquiring new ones; churn prediction helps inform targeted interventions to reduce attrition.
- **Approach:** Use classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and optionally XGBoost, along with model interpretation using SHAP/LIME.
